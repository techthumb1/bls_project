    "Welcome to the step-by-step guide on how to use the Employment Cost Index (NAICS) one-screen query system\n",
    "Employment Cost Trends: The Employment Cost Index measures the change over time in the cost of labor. The cost of labor includes wages and salaries and employer costs for employee benefits. The quarterly data covers establishments of all sizes in private industry (excluding farms and households) and the public sector (excluding federal government) for all of the United States.\n",

    "This tool lets users query the BLS databases for specific data series. For each survey and program, make a selection for each characteristic in the order listed. As you make your selection, the remaining characteristics will filter to show only choices where data are available. After choosing the series, click on “Add to selection.” If you need more data series, repeat the steps of choosing the data series you need. After you've finished finding the data series you need, click on the “Get Data” button to retrieve the data, and an HTML table with data for the most recent 10 years will display. If you desire a different time period or format, you may modify the options on the data display page, or click on the “More Formatting Options” button for additional options on refining the data retrieval results. Note: Users may not retrieve more than 200 data series in one query."
