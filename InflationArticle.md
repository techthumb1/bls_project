# Inflation? A Statistical Examination of Increasing Costs and it's Impact on Consumers

## What Is Inflation?

Inflation, we all know the word and some have felt the constraining effects of it, others see it as an investment opportunity, but what is it actually, why does it occur, and when will it change? We will cover these questions and more, in addition to, incorporating some predictive analysis to get a peek into future costs.

Inflation is the consistent rise of the cost of goods and services for which consumers conduct their spending on. There are actually three types of inflation:

- **International Price Inflation**: The rise in the price of goods and services across the world.
- **Producer Price Inflation**: The rise in the price of goods and services produced by a specific producer.
- **Consumer Price Index**: The CPI is the index of the consumer price. It is the average price of all goods and services in the economy.
- **Real Price Index**: The RPI is the index of the real price. It is the average price of all goods and services in the economy.
- **Inflation**: The inflation is the difference between the RPI and the CPI.
- **Growth Rate**: The growth rate is the percentage change in the RPI.
- **GDP**: The GDP is the total value of all goods and services in the economy.
- **GDP Growth Rate**: The GDP growth rate is the percentage change in the GDP.
- **GDP per Capita**: The GDP per capita is the GDP divided by the number of people in the economy.
- **Consumer Expenditure**: The consumer expenditure is the total amount of money spent by consumers on goods and services.


## Consumer Price Index

One of the primary drivers or indicators of inflation is the the _Consumer Price Index_. The Consumer Price Index or (CPI), is the measure of price changes for goods and services in a market basket such as gas, food, and utilities.

The CPI is used in many common economic capacities

## Consumer Expenditure Surveys

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics the 

[Consumer Expenditure Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cex/), the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) is a consumer-focused survey that measures the amount of money spent on goods and services by households. The survey is conducted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and is designed to measure the amount of money spent on goods and services by households in the United States.


## Analysis

In this section we will begin our analysis of the data. We would not expect significant changes to have occurred for the short-run, but anticipate those changes may be seen over the long-run. Features we will be using will be a variety of different components of the CPI:
- CPI-U (All Urban Consumers)
- CES (All Urban Consumers)
- Import/Export(All Urban Consumers)

## Phillipd Curve

We will examine the _Phillips Curve_ in relation to the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment. According to the _**Phillips Curve**_, a low unemployment rate, will result in a high rate of inflation, and vice versa. However, there is dispute of it's efficacy due to _**Stagflation**_, which is the effect of hight inflation and a high unemployment rate.
