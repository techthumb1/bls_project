# Inflation? A Statistical Examination of Increasing Costs and it's Impact on Consumers

Inflation, we all know the word and have felt the constraining effects of it, others see it as an investment opportunity but what is it actually, why does it occur, and when will it change? We will cover these questions and more.

Inflation is the cost of goods and services for consumers. There are actually three type of inflation:_International Price Inflation, Consumer Price Inflation, and Producer Price Inflation_. However, for the purposes of this article, we will focus on the **Consumer Price Inflation**.


## Consumer Price Index

One of the primary drivers or indicators of inflation is the the _Consumer Price Index_. The Consumer Price Index or (CPI), is the measure of price changes for goods and services in a market basket such as gas, food, and utilites. 



## Consumer Expenditure Surveys

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics the 

[Consumer Expenditure Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cex/), the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) is a consumer-focused survey that measures the amount of money spent on goods and services by households. The survey is conducted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and is designed to measure the amount of money spent on goods and services by households in the United States.


So to recap, when prices go up, we have inflation. When consumers spend more money due to inflation, we are able to measure the impact or change in prices.

We will examine the _Phillips Curve_ in relation to the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment. According to the _**Phillips Curve**_, a low unemployment rate, will result in a high rate of inflation, and vice versa. However, there is dispute of it's efficacy due to _**Stagflation**_, which is the effect of hight inflation and a high unemployment rate.
